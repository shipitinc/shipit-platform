# QA_GOVERNANCE.md — QA Governance Policy

This document defines the governance framework for quality assurance activities within the agentic
engineering lifecycle. It establishes roles, artifacts, processes, and gates that ensure QA rigor,
evidence-based decisions, and proper separation of concerns between QA definition, execution, and
implementation.

---

## Roles

### QA Architect
- **Authority**: Defines QA strategy, QA Contracts, golden baselines, and evidence standards.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Produce the **QA Contract** in parallel with the Design Contract (required before implementation completion).
  - Define acceptance criteria, test strategy, automated/visual/human QA scope.
  - Establish and maintain **visual golden baselines** for visual regression testing.
  - Define evidence standards: what constitutes valid deterministic evidence, how evidence is pinned to revisions.
  - Approve rebaselining of golden baselines (implementation agents **cannot** approve changed baselines).
  - Classify QA failures and route to appropriate remediation lane.
- **Constraints**:
  - Does not execute QA tests (that is QA Executor).
  - Does not implement production code.
  - Must declare `OWNED_PATHS` (QA Contracts, golden baselines, QA configs), `READ_ONLY_PATHS` (requirements, design contract, implementation code), `PROHIBITED_PATHS` (implementation source, deployment configs).

### QA Executor
- **Authority**: Executes automated, visual, and human QA per QA Contract; produces QA Results.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Run automated test suites (unit, integration, contract, e2e) per QA Contract.
  - Execute visual regression against golden baselines.
  - Coordinate and document human QA sessions (exploratory, usability, accessibility).
  - Preserve **all QA artifacts as evidence** (test reports, screenshots, videos, logs, traces).
  - Classify each failure per the QA Failure Classification taxonomy.
  - Produce machine-readable QA Results for the Engineering Manager.
- **Constraints**:
  - **Read-only with respect to production code and golden baselines** — never modifies implementation or approves baseline changes.
  - Does not define QA strategy or contracts.
  - Must declare `READ_ONLY_PATHS` (implementation, QA Contract, golden baselines), `OWNED_PATHS` (QA Result artifacts, test outputs), `PROHIBITED_PATHS` (implementation source, design artifacts, deployment configs).

## Artifacts

### QA Contract
**Purpose**: Defines the complete QA strategy and acceptance criteria for a feature/change. Required

  - `integration`: scope, service boundaries, tools
  - `contract`: consumer-driven contracts, schema validation
  - `e2e`: critical user flows, environments, tools
  - `visual`: pages/components, baseline references, tolerance thresholds
  - `human`: exploratory charters, usability tasks, accessibility standards (WCAG level)

```

---

## Evidence Rows & Determinations (`E_*`)

QA Contracts declare **evidence rows** (`E_*`). Each row is a first-class,
attributable line binding a contract-mandated evidence requirement to the
**feature-specific artifact(s)** and run prerequisites that will satisfy it.
Generic evidence slots (test reports, screenshots, logs) are placeholders; an
`E_*` row is the binding the QA Architect declares at **contract time** and the
QA Executor reports against in the **QA Result**. This gives feature-specific
artifacts a standard home without hand-editing a frozen contract or shipping
prose that no agent can act on.

### Evidence row model

A QA Contract evidence row carries:

- `evidence_id`: `E-01`, `E-02`, … (unique within the contract)
- `title` / `scope`: the requirement the row evidences
- `required`: `REQUIRED | OPTIONAL | NOT_APPLICABLE`
- `test_method`: `AUTOMATED | VISUAL | HUMAN | COMBINED`
- `artifact_ref`: **feature-specific** file/URL the row resolves to (e.g.
  `apps/app/integration_test/app_journey_test.dart`)
- `params`: run parameters the artifact needs (e.g. `--dart-define=
  E2E_VERIFICATION_CODE`, target device, environment variables)
- `prerequisites`: runnable-lane facts the row depends on (a CI device job, a
  headless device, services, credentials, platform)
- `traceability_refs`: requirements/design refs the row evidences
- `contract_determination`: `EXPECTED_TO_EXECUTE | CONTINGENT |
  SKIPPED_BY_CONTRACT` (declared at contract freeze)
- `determination_reasons`: mandatory prose when the contract declares anything
  other than `EXPECTED_TO_EXECUTE`

### Determinations (QA Result time)

| Determination | Meaning | When valid |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| `EXECUTED` | The row ran against the pinned revision and produced artifact-tracked evidence. | After successful execution with evidence. |
| `READY_NOT_EXECUTED` | The row is ready but has **not yet** run — the lane exists and the run is pending. | Interim state only; must transition to `EXECUTED` or a formal determination. |
| `SKIPPED` | The row is formally not executed, with recorded `reasons` + `authority_ref`. | Only with a recorded decision (`authority_ref`: managed determination or Human Decision). |

Gate results (`gate_results` in the QA Result) use `NOT_EXECUTED` for a gate
that has not run in this execution and `SKIPPED` for a gate whose evidence rows
were formally determined skipped.

### Rules

1. **Nothing is silently asserted.** No `E_*` row may carry a passing claim
   (`EXECUTED` / gate `PASS`) without artifact-tracked evidence pinned to the
   exact revision under test.
2. **Feature-specific bindings are first-class.** A row that needs a specific
   artifact must reference it via `artifact_ref` + `params` + `prerequisites`
   in the frozen contract — never hand-edited into a frozen contract or
   documented only in prose.
3. **A `REQUIRED` row that cannot run must be formally determined.** When the
   lane is unattainable (no CI device job, no headless device, missing
   platform/service), the row resolves to exactly one of:
   - make it runnable (add the lane), then `EXECUTED`;
   - `SKIPPED` with `reasons` + `authority_ref` (a consequential skip is a
     Human Decision);
   - or a contract revision that changes `required` (never silently).
4. **`READY_NOT_EXECUTED` is terminal-invalid as a resting state.** A row may
   not persist indefinitely as `REQUIRED` + `READY_NOT_EXECUTED`; it must reach
   `EXECUTED` or a formal `SKIPPED`. The Engineering Manager routes unattainable
   `REQUIRED` gates to the determination lane rather than leaving the gate open
   forever by default.
5. **`OPTIONAL` / `NOT_IN_DEFAULT_PIPELINE` rows are non-blocking by
   construction** and never imply a passing claim; they may rest at
   `READY_NOT_EXECUTED` without a formal decision.
6. **Determination changes are recorded** on the QA Result
   (`evidence_determinations`) and in the QA Contract status ledger; the same
   `E_*` row id is used across both.

## QA Execution Types

### Automated QA
- **Scope**: Unit, integration, contract, e2e tests defined in QA Contract.
- **Execution**: QA Executor runs in CI/CD pipeline or locally per QA Contract.
- **Evidence**: Test reports (JUnit, JSON), coverage reports, logs — all pinned to target revision.
- **Gate**: All required automated tests must pass (`PASS`) for `READY_FOR_MERGE`.
- **Deterministic Evidence Authority**: Test results are **authoritative over reviewer opinion**.
  A passing test suite cannot be overridden by a reviewer's subjective assessment.

### Visual QA
- **Scope**: Visual regression of pages/components against golden baselines.
- **Execution**: QA Executor runs perceptual/pixel diff tools per QA Contract thresholds.
- **Golden Baselines**:
  - Established by QA Architect, approved by Human QA or QA Architect.
  - **Implementation agents cannot approve changed golden baselines** — only QA Architect or Human QA.
  - Baseline changes require explicit approval recorded in QA Result.
- **Evidence**: Screenshots, diff images, perceptual scores — pinned to target revision.
- **Gate**: Visual regressions classified as failures; require classification and remediation.

### Human QA
- **Scope**: Exploratory testing, usability evaluation, accessibility audit per QA Contract.
- **Execution**: Human testers (or AI-assisted) following charters; QA Executor coordinates and documents.
- **Evidence**: Session notes, screen recordings, annotated screenshots, accessibility reports — pinned to target revision.
- **Gate**: Required when QA Contract specifies `human: REQUIRED` or when automated/visual QA cannot cover critical usability/accessibility criteria.
- **Trigger**: `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED` for Human QA initiation; results feed into QA Verdict.

---

## QA Failure Classification

Every QA failure **must** be classified as exactly one of:

| Classification | Definition | Remediation Lane |
|----------------|------------|------------------|
| `IMPLEMENTATION_DEFECT` | Code does not meet Design Contract or QA Contract acceptance criteria. | Correction Lane (Implementation) |
| `DESIGN_DEFECT` | Design Contract itself has a flaw (usability, accessibility, IA) that implementation correctly followed. | DCR Process (Design Governance) |
| `REQUIREMENT_GAP` | Requirements are ambiguous, incomplete, or contradictory; neither design nor implementation can resolve. | Requirements Clarification (Human Gate) |
| `ENVIRONMENT_DEFECT` | Failure caused by test environment, infrastructure, data, or configuration not under code control. | Infrastructure/Environment Remediation |

**Rules**:
- Classification is performed by QA Executor, reviewed by QA Architect.
- Misclassification is a process failure — requires retrospective.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_DEFECT` → routes to Correction / Re-review loop (WORKFLOW.md steps 22-23).
- `DESIGN_DEFECT` → routes to DCR (DESIGN_GOVERNANCE.md).
- `REQUIREMENT_GAP` → routes to Human Decision (HUMAN_DECISIONS.md).
- `ENVIRONMENT_DEFECT` → routes to Infra/DevOps remediation.

---

## Regression Policy

- **Every regression must have a regression test** added before re-verification.
- Regression test must be traceable to the original failure (`failure_id`).
- Regression test becomes part of the QA Contract for future runs.
- QA Result must record `regression_test_added: true` and `regression_test_ref`.

---

## Golden Baseline Governance

1. **Creation**: QA Architect creates baseline from a known-good revision; Human QA or QA Architect approves.
2. **Storage**: Baselines stored in versioned artifact store (not git LFS unless project policy).
3. **Comparison**: QA Executor compares current render against baseline using configured tool.
4. **Drift Detection**: Any diff exceeding threshold = visual regression failure.
5. **Rebaselining**:
   - Only QA Architect or Human QA can approve a new baseline.
   - Implementation agents **never** approve baseline changes.
   - Rebaselining requires explicit `golden_baseline_changes` entry in QA Result with approval reference.
6. **History**: All baseline versions retained for audit and rollback comparison.

---

## Process Gates

### Gate Q1: QA Contract Review
- **Trigger**: QA Contract created by QA Architect (parallel with Design Contract).
- **Reviewer**: Engineering Manager + Independent Engineering Reviewer (read-only).
- **Criteria**: Completeness, traceability to Design Contract/requirements, feasible test strategy, clear evidence standards.
- **Output**: `APPROVED` → freeze QA Contract; `CHANGES_REQUIRED` → QA Architect revises.

### Gate Q2: QA Contract Freeze (Pre-Implementation Completion)
- **Trigger**: QA Contract passes Gate Q1.
- **Constraint**: **Required before implementation reports `IMPLEMENTED`**.
- **Action**: Manager freezes QA Contract, records provenance.
- **Output**: `QA_CONTRACT_FROZEN` — implementation can now complete with known QA targets.

### Gate Q3: Automated QA Execution
- **Trigger**: Post-integration deployment to QA environment.
- **Executor**: QA Executor.
- **Criteria**: All required automated tests pass per QA Contract gate criteria.
- **Unrunnable-gate handling**: a `REQUIRED` gate that cannot execute is **not**
  silently skipped — the Executor records `NOT_EXECUTED` + reasons, and the
  Manager resolves it per the [Evidence Rows & Determinations](#evidence-rows--determinations-e_)
  rules (`EXECUTED`, formal `SKIPPED`, or contract revision).
- **Output**: QA Result with `overall_verdict`.

### Gate Q4: Visual QA Execution
- **Trigger**: Post-integration (can run parallel with Automated QA).
- **Executor**: QA Executor.
- **Criteria**: No visual regressions exceeding thresholds; or all regressions classified and approved for rebaseline.
- **Output**: QA Result with `visual` gate result.

### Gate Q5: Human QA Execution (when required)
- **Trigger**: QA Contract specifies `human: REQUIRED` or automated/visual gaps identified.
- **Authority**: Human QA initiation via structured question UI.
- **Executor**: Human testers coordinated by QA Executor.
- **Output**: QA Result with `human` gate result.

### Gate Q6: QA Verdict & Classification
- **Trigger**: All applicable QA executions complete.
- **Authority**: QA Architect reviews QA Results, classifies failures.
- **Criteria**: All failures classified; regression tests added for `IMPLEMENTATION_DEFECT`/`DESIGN_DEFECT`; remediation lanes assigned.
- **Output**: `READY_FOR_MERGE` | `BLOCKED` (with classified failures) | `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED`.

---

## Invariants

1. **QA Architect ≠ QA Executor** — separate agents, no overlap.
2. **QA Contract required before implementation completion** — no implementation can claim `IMPLEMENTED` without a frozen QA Contract.
3. **Deterministic evidence is authoritative over reviewer opinion** — passing tests cannot be vetoed by subjective review.
4. **Implementation agents cannot approve changed visual golden baselines** — only QA Architect or Human QA.
5. **QA artifacts must be preserved as evidence** — pinned to exact revision, retained per policy.
6. **Regressions require regression tests** — no re-verification without test.
7. **Every failure classified exactly once** — `IMPLEMENTATION_DEFECT`, `DESIGN_DEFECT`, `REQUIREMENT_GAP`, `ENVIRONMENT_DEFECT`.
8. **QA Executor is read-only wrt production code and baselines** — never modifies implementation or approves baselines.
9. **Only Engineering Manager advances lifecycle state** — QA agents produce results; Manager consumes and transitions.
10. **Every `E_*` evidence row is explicitly determined** — bound to
    feature-specific `artifact_ref`/`params`/`prerequisites` and reported with
    a determination. Nothing is silently asserted.
11. **A permanently-unrunnable `REQUIRED` gate must be formally determined** —
    made runnable, declared `SKIPPED` with reasons + `authority_ref`, or
    revised; it is never left as `REQUIRED` + `READY_NOT_EXECUTED` indefinitely.
