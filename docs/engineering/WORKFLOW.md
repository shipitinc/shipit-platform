# WORKFLOW.md — Reusable Engineering Lifecycle

This document describes the **high-level, reusable lifecycle** governed by this framework. It is
intentionally kept at the level of *stages and gates*. It **does not** over-specify implementation
details that have not yet been tested. Unresolved areas are marked explicitly with
`UNRESOLVED_FRAMEWORK_AREA`.

Legend:
- `AUTO` — routine transition. The Orchestrator/Manager advances it without asking for
  permission **only after all prerequisites and required gates for that transition are satisfied**.
- `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED` — a human gate for a consequential decision.
- `GATE` — a validation/approval checkpoint that must pass before proceeding.

### Automatic transitions vs. human gates (general rule)

These rules are authoritative wherever `AUTO`, `GATE`, and `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED` appear:

- `AUTO` means the Manager advances the workflow without asking for routine permission **only after
  all prerequisites and required gates for that transition are satisfied**. An unsatisfied gate
  blocks the automatic transition.
- A state that explicitly requires `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED` (or any other human authorization) can
  **never** be bypassed, skipped, or auto-resolved by an automatic transition.
- An agent **may automatically enter** a human-decision-required state when conditions require it
  (e.g., reaching a consequential architecture choice), but it **may not automatically resolve** that
  state; resolution requires the human decision. After the human decision is recorded, subsequent
  routine transitions may again proceed automatically.

## Lifecycle

### Phase 0: Foundation

1. **Product Requirements** `AUTO`
   Capture what the product must do. Produce a structured requirements artifact.

2. **Architecture Requirements Extraction** `AUTO`
   Derive architecture-relevant constraints and requirements from product requirements.

3. **Current Candidate Research** `AUTO`
   Research viable, current candidate technologies/approaches (BaaS vs. application backend,
   cloud/runtime providers, database, object storage, authentication, delivery topology, etc.).
   Research must reflect **current** information, not stale assumptions.

4. **Qualitative / Quantitative Analysis** `AUTO`
   Compare candidates on qualitative and quantitative criteria relevant to the product.

5. **Architecture Recommendation** `AUTO`
   Produce a recommendation with rationale and trade-offs.

6. **`HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED`** (where consequential) `GATE`
   Major architecture choices are human gates. Must be supported by current qualitative and
   quantitative research (steps 3–5).

7. **ADR (Architecture Decision Record)** `AUTO`
   Record the decision, context, options considered, and consequences.

8. **Git / Tooling / Cloud / Access Preflight** `GATE`
   Verify repository connectivity, CI/CD availability, infrastructure access, CLI availability,
   authentication and authorization **before** attempting bootstrap.

9. **Infrastructure Bootstrap** `AUTO` (may require `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED` for provisioning)
   Stand up environments and infrastructure per the ADR.

10. **CI/CD and Deployment Bootstrap** `AUTO` (deployment authority may be a human gate)
    Establish pipelines, environments, deployment strategy, and rollback.

11. **Architecture Verification** `GATE`
    Confirm the bootstrapped architecture behaves as designed.

### Phase 1: Design Governance

12. **Design Brief Creation** `AUTO`
    Design Agent produces a **Design Brief** from requirements and architecture constraints.
    The Design Brief captures: problem statement, user flows, success criteria, constraints,
    acceptance criteria, and risk assessment.

13. **Design Brief Review** `GATE`
    Independent Design Reviewer evaluates the Design Brief for completeness, consistency,
    feasibility, and alignment with requirements/architecture.

14. **`HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED`** (Design Brief Approval) `GATE`
    Human approves the Design Brief for design exploration. Consequential design direction
    decisions are human gates.

15. **Design Exploration & Revision** `AUTO` (loop)
    Design Agent produces **Design Revisions** (candidate designs) iteratively.
    Each revision is versioned with metadata: revision number, author, timestamp, changelog,
    risk level assessment, and traceability to Design Brief requirements.
    **All revisions are disposable revision candidates; canonical source artifacts are immutable.**
    See DESIGN_GOVERNANCE.md § Source-Artifact Immutability.

16. **Independent Design Review** `GATE`
    Independent Design Reviewer evaluates each Design Revision for:
    - Design system consistency (Level 1 risk)
    - UX coherence and accessibility (Level 2 risk)
    - Information architecture / workflow integrity (Level 3 risk)
    - Implementation feasibility
    - **Artifact write verification (readback confirmation)**
    - **Design-system asset reuse compliance**

17. **Design Change Request (DCR) Process** `AUTO` / `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED`
    - Level 0 (Implementation Correction): `AUTO` — routed to implementation lane
    - Level 1 (Design-System Correction): `AUTO` with design-system owner notification
    - Level 2 (Feature UX Change): `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED` for product/design approval
    - Level 3 (Major Workflow/Navigation/IA Change): `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED` with architecture review

18. **Human Visual Approval** `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED` `GATE`
    **Human visual inspection of the revision candidate artifact is required before canonical
    promotion.** Model self-QA is advisory only; artifact metadata and tool responses do not
    prove visual correctness. See DESIGN_GOVERNANCE.md.

19. **Approved Design Revision / Design Contract Freeze** `AUTO` (after gate passage)
    The approved Design Revision becomes the **Design Contract** — a frozen, versioned artifact
    that implementation must satisfy. Substantial UI changes require an approved Design Revision.
    Implementers must not invent consequential UX to fill design gaps.
    **Promotion = candidate artifact becomes canonical via recorded operation; source artifact
    immutability is preserved.**

20. **QA Contract Definition** `AUTO` (parallel with Design Contract)
    QA Architect defines the **QA Contract**: acceptance criteria, test strategy, automated/visual/
    human QA scope, golden baseline requirements, and evidence standards. Required before
    implementation completion.

### Phase 2: Implementation & Code Review

21. **Implementation** `AUTO`
    Implementers build against the Design Contract and QA Contract, declaring `OWNED_PATHS`,
    `READ_ONLY_PATHS`, and `PROHIBITED_PATHS`. Implementers never approve their own work.
    Implementation-discovered UI gaps route back into the design lifecycle via DCR.

22. **Deterministic Tests / Runtime / Browser Validation** `GATE`
    Required deterministic validation must pass. Runtime/browser evidence must correspond to the
    exact code revision under review.

23. **Independent Engineering Review** `GATE`
    An independent, read-only reviewer evaluates the implementation against:
    - Design Contract compliance
    - QA Contract test coverage
    - Architecture boundaries
    - Code quality and maintainability

24. **Correction / Re-review** `AUTO` (loop)
    Address findings and re-review until the gate passes. Bounded: after two failed cycles on
    the same substantive issue, classify and escalate if `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED`.

### Phase 3: QA Governance

25. **Integration** `AUTO`
    Integrate approved work into the integration branch.

26. **Automated QA Deployment** `AUTO` (when project policy permits)
    Deploy to QA environment deterministically after integration.

27. **Automated QA Execution** `GATE`
    QA Executor runs: unit, integration, contract, e2e tests per QA Contract.
    Deterministic evidence is authoritative over reviewer opinion.

28. **Visual QA Execution** `GATE`
    QA Executor runs visual regression against golden baselines.
    Implementation agents **cannot approve changed visual golden baselines** — only QA Architect
    or Human QA can rebaseline.

29. **Human QA Execution** (when required) `HUMAN_DECISION_REQUIRED` / `GATE`
    Exploratory, usability, accessibility testing per QA Contract.
    QA artifacts must be preserved as evidence.

30. **QA Verdict & Failure Classification** `GATE`
    QA classifies any failure as exactly one of:
    - `IMPLEMENTATION_DEFECT` → route to correction lane
    - `DESIGN_DEFECT` → route to DCR (Design Change Request)
    - `REQUIREMENT_GAP` → route to requirements clarification (human gate)
    - `ENVIRONMENT_DEFECT` → route to infrastructure/environment remediation
    Regressions require regression tests before re-verification.

### Phase 4: Local QA Deployment

31. **Merge** `AUTO`
    Merge to main/trunk branch after all QA gates pass.

32. **Local QA Deployment** `AUTO` (when project policy permits)
    Rebuild and restart the local QA Docker Compose stack (`docker/compose.qa.yaml`)
    to deploy the newly merged changes. This is the only deployment step in this workflow;
    staging and production deployment are intentionally omitted.

### Phase 5: Learning & Improvement

33. **Repository Learning** `AUTO`
    Persist verified discoveries per [LEARNING_POLICY.md](LEARNING_POLICY.md).

34. **Framework Improvement Candidates** (where generally reusable) `AUTO` → review
    Promote generally reusable lessons as framework improvement candidates. Material
    workflow-framework changes require independent review; consequential governance changes
    require human approval.

## Resolved framework areas

- **Manager orchestration as an invocable procedure** — RESOLVED by
  [ADR 0003](adr/0003-product-generic-orchestrator-skill.md): the `aef-orchestrator` skill is the
  **operational counterpart** of the Manager invariants in `AGENTS.md`. It makes the top-level session
  a **dispatching orchestrator** (decompose → dispatch to isolated lanes with declared ownership and
  full provenance → collect structured results → integrate only independently reviewed results) and
  defines the dispatch/report contracts
  (`.agents/skills/aef-orchestrator/templates/subtask-prompt.md`,
  `.agents/skills/aef-orchestrator/templates/subtask-report.md`) and the plain-file state convention
  that keeps Manager state
  recoverable after a crash or compaction. It **delegates to** the existing lane skills
  (`aef-design-workflow`, `aef-design-review`, `aef-qa-contract`, `aef-qa-execution`,
  `aef-implementation-workflow`, `aef-independent-review`, `aef-correction-loop`,
  `aef-deployment-execution`, `aef-human-decision`, `aef-repository-learning`) and **adds no stage and
  no human gate**. That ADR also fixes the **platform matrix**: `.agents/` is the canonical source of
  truth and `.claude/`, `.junie/`, and `.opencode/` are **generated-only** output — never
  hand-maintained — machine-verified by the adapter drift test. This document — and
  `AGENTS.md`/`HUMAN_DECISIONS.md` — remain authoritative wherever the skill and this document differ.

- **Distribution/versioning of framework artifacts to product repositories** — RESOLVED at the
  architecture level by [ADR 0001](adr/0001-framework-distribution-and-versioning.md):
  **versioned copy-based installation** with **deterministic provenance** (authoritative
  `framework.revision`, per-artifact install/source hashes) and **reviewable, isolated 3-way-merge
  upgrades** that preserve product-specific knowledge. Normal product operation requires **no**
  runtime access to the framework repository or any package registry.

- **How an upgrade merge is computed and delivered** — RESOLVED by
  [ADR 0004](adr/0004-upgrade-three-way-merge-and-delivery.md): the documented three-way merge
  (**base** = render of the pinned revision A, **local** = the product's own state, **incoming** = render
  of revision B) is computed **without a working-tree copy** by giving git three synthetic commits that
  share the base render as their parent and merging them with `git merge-tree --write-tree`. The result
  is delivered as **one commit on the product repository's real `HEAD`**, pushed to
  `framework/upgrade-<A>-<B>` for review, with the refreshed `framework-manifest.yaml` inside it, pinned
  to the exact revision object id. The product's working tree and index are **never** mutated, a conflict
  is delivered (with markers) and reported rather than stranded, a re-run never overwrites an upgrade
  awaiting review, and all scratch state is discarded on every exit path. Two cases are handled
  explicitly: **brick staging artifacts** (byte-identical copies of the brick's own build inputs, which
  no render can produce) are removed from the delivered tree and reported, and a product that carries no
  render of its pinned revision **adopts** the incoming render instead of merging against a fictional
  base. Requires `git >= 2.38` for `git merge-tree --write-tree`.

- **Framework driver / tooling selection** — RESOLVED by
  [ADR 0002](adr/0002-dart-mason-git-framework-driver.md): the driver is
  **Dart + Mason + Git** with **`framework-manifest.yaml`** as authoritative provenance. Dart owns
  CLI/orchestration; Mason owns template rendering only; Git owns native 3-way merge/versioning
  mechanics; a **custom text merge engine is prohibited**. This selection was validated by an
  empirical proof-of-concept (`DART_MASON_GIT_POC_PASS`, no architecture blockers). ADR 0002 records
  the mandatory POC-derived mitigations, exit-code and structured-result contracts, and a phased
  implementation plan. The **production CLI is not yet implemented** — implementation is explicitly
  deferred to the phased plan (next state: Phase 1 CLI skeleton/domain model); the driver is **not**
  production-ready merely because the POC passed. See [framework/templates/](../../framework/templates/).
